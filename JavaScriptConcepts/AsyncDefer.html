    <title>Async and Defer</title>
    <!-- When the browser loads HTML and comes across a <script>...</script> tag, it can’t continue building the DOM. It must 
        execute the script first. That leads to two important issues:
        Scripts can’t see DOM elements below them, so they can’t add handlers etc.
        If there’s a bulky script at the top of the page, it “blocks the page”. -->
        DEFER:
        <!-- Scripts with defer never block the page.
            Scripts with defer always execute when the DOM is ready (but before DOMContentLoaded event). 
            The page content shows up immediately.
            DOMContentLoaded event handler waits for the deferred script. It only triggers when the script is downloaded and executed. Deferred scripts keep their relative order, just like regular scripts.-->
        Async:
        <!-- The async attribute means that a script is completely independent:
            The browser doesn’t block on async scripts (like defer).
            Other scripts don’t wait for async scripts, and async scripts don’t wait for them.
            DOMContentLoaded and async scripts don’t wait for each other: -->
